Hugo combined with the Aether theme turns easy to write markdown into powerful web pages.  KaTeX, Highlight.js, and Hugo provides the ability to create mathmatical symobols, equations, highlighted code, tables, lists, and much more.

For each feature below, the first line is the markdown and the second line is the result after Hugo, KaTeX, and Highlight.js process the markdown.  You can find many more features in the Hugo documentation.

## LaTeX style math typsetting with KaTeX

```md
{{</* raw */>}}
\[u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_{0}^{t} e(\tau) d\tau + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt} \]
{{</* /raw */>}}
```

{{< raw >}}
\[u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_{0}^{t} e(\tau) d\tau + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt} \]
{{< /raw >}}

## Images

## Small Images

```md
{{</* smallimg src="featuredImage" alt="NYC Skyline" smartfloat="left" width="250px" */>}}
```

{{<smallimg src="featuredImage" alt="aether theme displayed on an iPhone" smartfloat="left" width="250px">}}

This image floats to the left of this paragraph and is 250px wide. Its aspect ratio is maintained so it will not stretch. The picture shows the New York skyline. You can see how the design is responsive and how the cards intelligently fit to the display. With flexbox and css grid, heavy frameworks such as bootstrap aren't necessary to create beautiful responsive designs. The cards in aether use flexbox to change the image from the right side on desktops to the top on mobile.
